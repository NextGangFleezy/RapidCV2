Build a full-stack web app called "Rapid CV" in Replit. This is a SaaS platform that helps users create and optimize resumes tailored for specific job applications using AI.

🌐 Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS):
- Pages:
  • Landing Page
  • Resume Builder Page (editable form + live preview)
  • Job Tailoring Page (upload or paste job description, match skills, rewrite resume)
  • PDF Export Page
  • Contact/Feedback Page

- Features:
  • Resume Editing Form: Name, Summary, Work Experience, Education, Skills, Projects
  • Add/remove sections dynamically
  • Live Preview Panel
  • Resume Templates (choose from 2–3 layouts)
  • PDF Export with one click
  • "Tailor to Job" button that opens JD Matching modal

🧠 Backend (Node.js + Express):
- Endpoints:
  • POST /analyze-jd: Accepts job description + resume JSON, returns transferable skills + tailored resume
  • POST /export-pdf: Converts resume HTML to PDF
  • POST /save-resume: (MVP - in memory, DB ready)

- JD Analysis Logic:
  • Use OpenAI API (GPT-4 or 3.5-turbo) to:
    - Parse the job description
    - Extract key responsibilities + required skills
    - Match them to the user’s resume
    - Reword and enhance resume bullets to better fit the job description
    - Return a new tailored version of the resume for editing or download

📦 File Structure:
- /client → React frontend (pages, components, styles)
- /server → Express backend (routes, OpenAI API calls, PDF gen)
- /shared → Models, Resume schemas

✨ Smart Features:
- Skill Matching Highlight: Show which skills were detected in both resume and job description
- “Improve Summary” GPT feature: Rewrites the summary based on matched JD
- Pre-written bullet suggestions for each section
- "ATS Check": Show whether resume includes enough relevant keywords (optional phase 2)

🔐 Security & Infra:
- CORS enabled
- OpenAI API key in .env
- Add basic error handling and request validation
- Frontend deployed to Vercel, backend hosted on Replit or Railway

🎯 MVP Goal:
"Create. Match. Tailor. Download. Land the job."
